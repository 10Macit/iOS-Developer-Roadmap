## Why this topics?
See this article (COMING SOON) explainig selection of topics.

## How to use this roadmap
1. Find a topic you want to study.
2. Go to corresponding resources section.
3. Study untill you can confidently explain the topic to your cat.
4. (Optional) tick the checkbox next to the topic. [How to tick a checkbox](Resources/HOWTOCHECKBOX.md).
4. Go to step 1.

<mark>Essential topics</mark> are topics which significantly contributes to understanding of iOS development. Consequently, it is a good idea to study them first as they are often encountered on interviews.

Start from `Getting started` section if you haven't done any iOS development yet.
